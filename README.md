# furrr

The goal of furrr is to simplify the combination of `purrr`’s family of
mapping functions and `future`’s parallel processing capabilities. A new
set of `future_map_*()` functions have been defined, and can be used as
(hopefully) drop in replacements for the corresponding `map_*()`
function.

The code draws *heavily* from the implementations of `purrr` and
`future.apply` and this package would not be possible without either of
them.

## What has been implemented?

The full range of `map()`, `map2()`, `pmap()`, `walk()`, `imap()`,
`modify()`, and `invoke_map()` functions have been implemented.

This includes strict versions like `map_dbl()` through
`future_map_dbl()` and predicate versions like `map_at()` through
`future_map_at()`.

## Installation

You can install the released version of furrr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("furrr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavisVaughan/furrr")
```

## Example

`furrr` has been designed to function identically to `purrr`, so that
you can immediately have familiarity with it.

``` r
library(furrr)
library(purrr)

map(c("hello", "world"), ~.x)
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "hello"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] "world"

future_map(c("hello", "world"), ~.x)
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "hello"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] "world"
```

The default backend for `future` is a sequential one. This means that
the code will run out of the box, but it will *not* be in parallel. The
design of `future` makes this incredibly easy to change so that your
code does run in
parallel.

``` r
# You set a "plan" for how the code should run. The easiest is `multiprocess`
# On Mac this picks plan(multicore) and on Windows this picks plan(multisession)
plan(multiprocess)

# This DOES run in parallel!
future_map(c("hello", "world"), ~.x)
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "hello"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] "world"
```

If you are still skeptical, here is some proof that we are running in
parallel.

``` r
library(tictoc)

# This should take 6 seconds in total running sequentially
plan(sequential)
tic()
nothingness <- future_map(c(2, 2, 2), ~Sys.sleep(.x))
toc()
#> 6.08 sec elapsed
```

``` r
# This should take ~2 seconds running in parallel, with a little overhead
plan(multiprocess)
tic()
nothingness <- future_map(c(2, 2, 2), ~Sys.sleep(.x))
toc()
#> 2.212 sec elapsed
```

## Progress bars

Who doesn’t love progress bars? For `multiprocess`, `multicore`, and
`multisession` plans, you can activate a progress bar for your long
running task with `.progress = TRUE`. Note that these are still a bit
experimental so feedback is welcome. You should get a nice progress bar
that looks like this:

## A more compelling use case

This example comes from a Vignette from `rsample`. The vignette performs
a 10 fold cross validation with 10 repeats of a GLM on the attrition
data set. If you want all the details with explanation, see [the
vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsample/vignettes/Working_with_rsets.html).

The vignette example runs pretty quickly on its own, so to make things
more…interesting we are going to use 20 fold CV with 100 repeats.

``` r
library(rsample)
data("attrition")
names(attrition)
#>  [1] "Age"                      "Attrition"               
#>  [3] "BusinessTravel"           "DailyRate"               
#>  [5] "Department"               "DistanceFromHome"        
#>  [7] "Education"                "EducationField"          
#>  [9] "EnvironmentSatisfaction"  "Gender"                  
#> [11] "HourlyRate"               "JobInvolvement"          
#> [13] "JobLevel"                 "JobRole"                 
#> [15] "JobSatisfaction"          "MaritalStatus"           
#> [17] "MonthlyIncome"            "MonthlyRate"             
#> [19] "NumCompaniesWorked"       "OverTime"                
#> [21] "PercentSalaryHike"        "PerformanceRating"       
#> [23] "RelationshipSatisfaction" "StockOptionLevel"        
#> [25] "TotalWorkingYears"        "TrainingTimesLastYear"   
#> [27] "WorkLifeBalance"          "YearsAtCompany"          
#> [29] "YearsInCurrentRole"       "YearsSinceLastPromotion" 
#> [31] "YearsWithCurrManager"
```

Set up an rsample split tibble of 20 fold CV with 100 repeats.

``` r
set.seed(4622)
rs_obj <- vfold_cv(attrition, v = 20, repeats = 100)
rs_obj
#> #  20-fold cross-validation repeated 100 times 
#> # A tibble: 2,000 x 3
#>    splits       id        id2   
#>    <list>       <chr>     <chr> 
#>  1 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold01
#>  2 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold02
#>  3 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold03
#>  4 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold04
#>  5 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold05
#>  6 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold06
#>  7 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold07
#>  8 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold08
#>  9 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold09
#> 10 <S3: rsplit> Repeat001 Fold10
#> # ... with 1,990 more rows
```

The model formula below is going to be used in the
GLM.

``` r
mod_form <- as.formula(Attrition ~ JobSatisfaction + Gender + MonthlyIncome)
```

For each split, we want to calculate assessments on the holdout data, so
a function was created to allow us to apply the model and easily extract
what we need from each split.

``` r
library(broom)
## splits will be the `rsplit` object with the 95/5 partition
holdout_results <- function(splits, ...) {
  # Fit the model to the 95%
  mod <- glm(..., data = analysis(splits), family = binomial)
  # Save the 5%
  holdout <- assessment(splits)
  # `augment` will save the predictions with the holdout data set
  res <- broom::augment(mod, newdata = holdout)
  # Class predictions on the assessment set from class probs
  lvls <- levels(holdout$Attrition)
  predictions <- factor(ifelse(res$.fitted > 0, lvls[2], lvls[1]),
                        levels = lvls)
  # Calculate whether the prediction was correct
  res$correct <- predictions == holdout$Attrition
  # Return the assessment data set with the additional columns
  res
}
```

Finally, `purrr` was used to map over all of the splits, apply the model
to each, and extract the results.

First in sequential order…

``` r
library(purrr)
library(tictoc)

tic()
rs_obj$results <- map(rs_obj$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)
toc()
#> 30.095 sec elapsed
```

Then in parallel…

``` r
library(furrr)
plan(multiprocess)

tic()
rs_obj$results <- future_map(rs_obj$splits, holdout_results, mod_form)
toc()
#> 14.211 sec elapsed
```

We don’t get a 4x improvement on my 4 core Mac, but we do get a nice 2x
speed up without doing any hard work. The reason we don’t get a 4x
improvement is likely because of time spent transfering data to each R
process, so this penalty will be minimized with longer running tasks and
you might see better performance (for example, 100 fold CV with 100
repeats gave `122` seconds sequentially and `48` seconds in parallel).
The implementation of `future_lapply()` does include a scheduling
feature, which carried over nicely into `furrr` and efficiently breaks
up the list of splits into 4 equal subsets. Each is passed to 1 core of
my machine.

## A few notes on performance

### Data transfer

It’s important to remember that data has to be passed back and forth
between the cores. This means that whatever performance gain you might
have gotten from your parallelization can be crushed by moving large
amounts of data around. For example, if instead of returning a results
data frame in the above example, we returned the larger `glm` model
object for each split, our performance drops a bit.

``` r
model_only <- function(splits, ...) {
  # Fit the model to the 95%
  mod <- glm(..., data = analysis(splits), family = binomial)
  
  mod
}

plan(multiprocess)

tic()
rs_obj$results2 <- future_map(rs_obj$splits, model_only, mod_form)
toc()
#> 20.807 sec elapsed
```

Luckily, the `glm` model is relatively small, so we don’t experience
much loss, but there are model objects out there that can be 10’s of MBs
in size. For models like those, I would advise wrapping up the work you
want each core to do into a function, and only returning the actual
performance metric you are looking for. This might mean a little bit
more work on your side, but it results in smaller objects, and faster
performance.

This performance drop can especially be prominent if using
`future_pmap()` to iterate over rows and return large objects at each
iteration.

### Progress bars

Progress bars are best used when iterating over relatively few long
running tasks. For instance, they are great when training over
hyperparameters of a deep learning model, but I would not suggest them
when iterating over the rows of a 100k row data frame. I’ve used every
trick that I know to make them have minimal performance impact, but you
will see degredation when using them with *lots* of elements to iterate
over.

## What has not been implemented (yet)?
