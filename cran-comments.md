## 0.1.0 Resubmission

This resubmission wraps `plan(multisession)` and `plan(multiprocess)` in
`\donttest{}` for examples that use them. This results in the examples still
running correctly, just sequentially and not in parallel. The `future` package
does a similar thing.

## 0.1.0 Submission

This is the first release of `furrr`, a package aimed at running the `purrr`
mapping functions in parallel using futures from the `future` package.
