    c(person(given = "Davis",
             family = "Vaughan",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "davis@rstudio.com"),

Description: Implementations of the family of map() functions
    from 'purrr' that can be resolved using any 'future'-supported
    backend, e.g. parallel on the local machine or distributed on a
    compute cluster.
